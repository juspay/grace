# Global Rapid Agentic Connector Exchange for UCS (GRACE-UCS)

GRACE-UCS is a specialized AI-assisted system for UCS (Universal Connector Service) connector development that supports **complete connector lifecycle management** - from initial implementation to continuation of partially completed work.

## 🎯 Core Purpose

GRACE-UCS enables:
- **Full connector implementation** from scratch
- **Resuming partial implementations** where developers left off
- **All payment method support** (cards, wallets, bank transfers, BNPL, etc.)
- **Complete flow coverage** (authorize, capture, void, refund, sync, webhooks, etc.)
- **UCS-specific patterns** tailored for gRPC-based stateless architecture

## 🏗️ UCS Architecture Overview

The UCS connector-service uses a modern, stateless architecture:

```
backend/
├── connector-integration/     # Connector-specific logic
│   ├── src/connectors/       # Individual connector implementations
│   └── src/types.rs          # Common types and utilities
├── domain-types/             # Domain models and data structures
├── grpc-server/             # gRPC service implementation
└── grpc-api-types/          # Protocol buffer definitions
```

### Key UCS Characteristics:
- **gRPC-first**: All communication via Protocol Buffers
- **Stateless**: No database dependencies in connector logic
- **RouterDataV2**: Enhanced type-safe data flow
- **ConnectorIntegrationV2**: Modern trait-based integration
- **Domain-driven**: Clear separation of concerns

## 🚀 Usage Scenarios

### 1. **New Connector Implementation**
```
integrate [ConnectorName] using grace-ucs/.gracerules
```

### 2. **Resume Partial Implementation**
```
continue implementing [ConnectorName] connector in UCS - I have partially implemented [specific_flows] and need to complete [remaining_flows]
```

### 3. **Add Missing Flows**
```
add [flow_names] flows to existing [ConnectorName] connector in UCS
```

### 4. **Debug/Fix Issues**
```
fix [ConnectorName] connector issues in UCS - having problems with [specific_issue_description]
```

### 5. **Add Payment Methods**
```
add support for [payment_method_types] to [ConnectorName] connector in UCS
```

## 📋 Comprehensive Flow Support

### Core Payment Flows
- **Authorization** - Initial payment authorization
- **Capture** - Capture authorized payments
- **Void/Cancel** - Cancel authorized payments
- **Refund** - Full and partial refunds
- **Sync** - Payment status synchronization
- **Refund Sync** - Refund status synchronization

### Advanced Flows
- **Create Order** - Multi-step payment initiation
- **Session Token** - Secure payment session management
- **Setup Mandate** - Recurring payment setup

## 📖 How to Use GRACE-UCS

### For New Implementation:
1. Place connector API documentation in `grace-ucs/references/{{connector_name}}/`
2. Run: `integrate [ConnectorName] using grace-ucs/.gracerules`
3. AI will create complete implementation plan and code

### For Resuming Work:
1. Describe current state: "I have [existing_functionality] implemented"
2. Specify what you need: "Need to add [missing_functionality]"
3. AI will analyze existing code and continue from there

### For Debugging:
1. Describe the issue: "Getting [error_description] when [specific_scenario]"
2. AI will analyze code, identify issue, and provide fix

## 🔧 UCS-Specific Patterns

GRACE-UCS provides dedicated pattern files for each payment flow:

### Available Flow Patterns
- **📖 `guides/patterns/README.md`** - Pattern directory index and usage guide
- **✅ `guides/patterns/pattern_authorize.md`** - Complete authorization flow patterns and implementations
- **✅ `guides/patterns/pattern_capture.md`** - Comprehensive capture flow patterns and examples
- **🚧 Future patterns**: void, refund, sync, webhook, dispute flows

### Pattern Usage
Each pattern file provides:
- **🎯 Quick Start Guide** with placeholder replacement examples
- **📊 Real-world Analysis** from existing connector implementations
- **🏗️ Modern Macro-Based Templates** for consistent implementations
- **🔧 Legacy Manual Patterns** for special cases
- **🧪 Testing Strategies** and integration checklists
- **✅ Validation Steps** and quality checks

### Using Patterns with AI
```bash
# Use specific patterns for targeted implementation
implement authorization flow for NewPayment using pattern_authorize.md
add capture flow to ExistingConnector using pattern_capture.md
implement complete connector flows using guides/patterns/ directory
```

### Connector Structure
```rust
// Main connector file: backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/connector_name.rs
impl ConnectorIntegrationV2<Flow, Request, Response> for ConnectorName {
    // UCS-specific implementations using patterns from guides/patterns/
}

// Transformers: backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/connector_name/transformers.rs
// Request/response transformations for all payment methods and flows
```

### Data Flow
```
gRPC Request → RouterDataV2 → Connector Transform → HTTP Request → External API
External Response → Connector Transform → RouterDataV2 → gRPC Response
```

## 🛡️ Quality Enforcement System

GRACE-UCS includes an automated **Quality Guardian Subagent** (8th subagent) that ensures every connector meets high quality standards.

### Quality Review Process

```
Foundation → Flow Implementation → All Flows Complete → Cargo Build ✅
                                                              ↓
                                                    Quality Guardian Review
                                                              ↓
                                        Quality Score ≥ 60? ──┬── Yes → ✅ Approved
                                                              │
                                                              └── No → ❌ Blocked (Fix Required)
```

### When Quality Review Runs

The Quality Guardian activates **ONCE** after all flows are implemented and code compiles successfully:
- ✅ All 6 flows completed (Authorize, PSync, Capture, Refund, RSync, Void)
- ✅ Cargo build passes without errors
- 🛡️ Quality Guardian performs comprehensive review
- ⚖️ Quality score calculated based on UCS compliance

### Quality Scoring System

```
Quality Score = 100 - (Critical Issues × 20) - (Warnings × 5) - (Suggestions × 1)

Thresholds:
95-100: Excellent ✨ - Auto-approve, document success patterns
80-94:  Good ✅ - Approve with minor notes
60-79:  Fair ⚠️ - Approve with warnings, recommend fixes
40-59:  Poor ❌ - Block until critical issues fixed
0-39:   Critical 🚨 - Block immediately, requires rework
```

### What Gets Reviewed

**UCS Pattern Compliance:**
- RouterDataV2 usage (not RouterData)
- ConnectorIntegrationV2 usage (not ConnectorIntegration)
- domain_types imports (not hyperswitch_*)
- Generic connector struct pattern

**Code Quality:**
- No code duplication across flows
- Consistent error handling
- Proper status mapping
- Payment method support
- Cross-flow consistency

**Security & Performance:**
- No exposed credentials
- Efficient resource usage
- Proper input validation
- Security best practices
