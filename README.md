# GRACE
**Global Rapid Agentic Connector Exchange**

GRACE is a comprehensive toolkit for building and managing connector integrations through intelligent automation and code generation.

## Overview

GRACE provides a modular architecture with specialized tools for different aspects of connector development, from research and specification generation to automated code generation and testing.

## Modules

The `modules/` directory contains different sets of tools and modules for various tasks:

### 🔍 DeepResearch
Advanced research capabilities for connector analysis and discovery.

### 📋 TechSpecGenerator
A powerful TypeScript CLI tool that automates API integration research and planning using real LangGraph workflows. This module crawls API documentation, extracts content, generates technical specifications using AI, and creates mock servers with an interactive command-line interface.

**Key Features:**
- Real LangGraph workflow management with @langchain/langgraph
- Interactive CLI for API documentation processing
- Web crawling and content extraction to markdown
- AI-powered technical specification generation
- Express.js mock server generation
- Full TypeScript support with type safety

### 🔌 CodeGenForHSConnector
Code generation tools specifically designed for Hyperswitch connector development.

### 🔗 CodeGenForUCSConnector
Code generation utilities for UCS (Unified Connector Service) implementations.

### 🧪 CypressCodeGen
Automated test generation using Cypress for connector validation and testing.
