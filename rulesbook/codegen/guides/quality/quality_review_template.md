```bash
# Analyze modified files
Files to review:
- backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/[connector_name].rs

```

### 3. Quality Scoring
```bash
# Count issues by severity
critical_count = [count critical issues]
warning_count = [count warning issues]
suggestion_count = [count suggestion issues]

# Calculate score
quality_score = 100 - (critical_count √ó 20) - (warning_count √ó 5) - (suggestion_count √ó 1)

### üö® Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Proceeding) - Count: 3

#### CRITICAL-1: Using RouterData Instead of RouterDataV2

**Feedback ID:** FB-001
**Category:** UCS_PATTERN_VIOLATION
**Location:** `example_connector.rs:25`

**Problem:**
Implementation uses legacy `RouterData` type instead of UCS-required `RouterDataV2`.

**Current Code:**
```rust
impl ConnectorIntegration<Authorize, RouterData<...>> {
    // ...
}
```

**Required Fix:**
```rust
impl ConnectorIntegrationV2<
    Authorize,
    PaymentFlowData,
    PaymentsAuthorizeData<T>,
    PaymentsResponseData
> for ExampleConnector<T> {
    // ...
}
```

**Why This Is Critical:**
Breaks UCS architectural requirements. Will cause integration failures.

**Estimated Fix Time:** 15 minutes

---

[Additional critical issues...]

### üéØ Decision & Next Steps

**Decision:** ‚ùå BLOCK UNTIL FIXES APPLIED

**Blocking Justification:**
Multiple critical UCS pattern violations prevent proceeding.

**Required Actions:**
1. Replace RouterData with RouterDataV2 in example_connector.rs:25
2. Update imports to use domain_types in example_connector.rs:1-10
3. Add generic type parameter to struct in example_connector.rs:15

**Estimated Total Fix Time:** 30 minutes
