# GRACE
**Global Rapid Agentic Connector Exchange**

GRACE is a comprehensive toolkit for building and managing connector integrations through intelligent automation and code generation.

## Overview

GRACE provides a modular architecture with specialized tools for different aspects of connector development, from research and specification generation to automated code generation and testing.

## Modules

The `modules/` directory contains four specialized tools for connector development:

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive integration guide with reusable framework
- Support for all payment flows (authorize, capture, refund, sync, etc.)
- Template-based connector generation
- Integration planning and technical specification templates
- Step-by-step implementation guidance

### üîó CodeGenForUCSConnector
A specialized AI-assisted system for UCS (Universal Connector Service) connector development that supports complete connector lifecycle management - from initial implementation to continuation of partially completed work.

**Key Features:**
- Resume partial implementations where developers left off
- Complete flow coverage (authorize, capture, void, refund, sync, webhooks, etc.)
- All payment method support (cards, wallets, bank transfers, BNPL, etc.)
- UCS-specific patterns tailored for gRPC-based stateless architecture
- Flow-specific pattern files with real-world examples
- Template generation for consistent implementations

## üöÄ Usage Guide

GRACE provides different tools for different stages of connector development. Choose the appropriate workflow based on your needs:

### üîç For Research & Discovery
**Use DeepResearchCLI when you need to:**
- Research payment provider APIs and documentation
- Gather comprehensive information about payment flows
- Analyze competitor implementations
- Create detailed research reports for planning

```bash
cd modules/DeepResearchCLI
npm install
npm run setup    # Sets up SearxNG search engine
npm start       # Interactive research mode
```

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Research a payment provider
npm start research
# Enter query: "Stripe payment API integration guide"
# AI will conduct deep research and generate comprehensive reports
```

### üìã For API Documentation Processing
**Use TechSpecGenerator when you need to:**
- Process existing API documentation
- Generate technical specifications from docs
- Create mock servers for testing
- Convert documentation to structured formats

```bash
cd modules/TechSpecGenerator
npm install
npm run build
api-doc-processor --create-config  # Create config file
api-doc-processor                  # Interactive workflow
```

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Process PayPal API documentation
api-doc-processor
# Enter URLs: https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/
# AI will crawl, extract, and generate tech specs
```

### üîå For Hyperswitch Connector Development
**Use CodeGenForHSConnector when you need to:**
- Integrate new payment connectors into Hyperswitch
- Follow Hyperswitch-specific patterns and flows
- Generate connector code for the main Hyperswitch repository

```bash
# In your Hyperswitch repository
git clone https://github.com/juspay/grace.git
# Use with AI assistant:
integrate [ConnectorName] using .gracerules
```

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# AI command for new connector
integrate Razorpay using .gracerules
# AI will create tech spec, implementation plan, and generate code
```

### üîó For UCS Connector Development
**Use CodeGenForUCSConnector when you need to:**
- Develop connectors for UCS (Universal Connector Service)
- Resume partial implementations
- Add specific payment flows to existing connectors
- Work with gRPC-based stateless architecture

```bash
# For new UCS connector
integrate [ConnectorName] using grace-ucs/.gracerules

# For resuming work
continue implementing [ConnectorName] connector in UCS - I have [existing_flows] and need [missing_flows]

# For adding specific flows
add [flow_names] flows to existing [ConnectorName] connector in UCS
```

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Start new UCS connector
integrate Adyen using grace-ucs/.gracerules

# Resume partial work
continue implementing Stripe connector in UCS - I have authorization and need capture, refund flows

# Add payment methods
add wallet payments to PayPal connector in UCS
```

## üìñ Detailed Workflow Examples

### Complete Connector Integration Workflow

#### 1. Research Phase (DeepResearchCLI)
```bash
cd modules/DeepResearchCLI
npm start
# Query: "Klarna payments API integration guide"
# Result: Comprehensive research report with API details
```

#### 2. Documentation Processing (TechSpecGenerator)
```bash
cd modules/TechSpecGenerator
api-doc-processor
# Input: Klarna developer documentation URLs
# Result: Structured tech spec and mock server
```

#### 3. Implementation (CodeGenForUCSConnector)
```bash
# Place research results in grace-ucs/references/klarna/
integrate Klarna using grace-ucs/.gracerules
# Result: Complete UCS connector implementation
```

### Troubleshooting Existing Connector

#### 1. Debug with UCS Tools
```bash
fix Stripe connector issues in UCS - getting timeout errors on authorization flow
# AI will analyze code and provide fixes
```

#### 2. Research Solutions (DeepResearchCLI)
```bash
cd modules/DeepResearchCLI
npm start
# Query: "Stripe API timeout handling best practices"
# Result: Research on timeout handling strategies
```

### Adding New Payment Methods

#### 1. Research Payment Method (DeepResearchCLI)
```bash
# Research specific payment method requirements
npm start
# Query: "Apple Pay integration requirements and flows"
```

#### 2. Implement in UCS (CodeGenForUCSConnector)
```bash
add Apple Pay support to existing Stripe connector in UCS
# AI will add wallet payment method support
```
