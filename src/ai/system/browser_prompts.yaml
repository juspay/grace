      "action": "click|type|scroll|navigate|wait|complete|error",
      "reasoning": "detailed explanation of what element you identified and why",
      "coordinates": [x, y] (precise center coordinates for click actions),
      "text": "exact text to type" (for type actions),
      "direction": "up|down" (for scroll actions),
      "url": "complete url" (for navigate actions),
      "success": true|false,
      "message": "status message"
