  Generate documentation that serves as a faithful representation of the API capabilities based solely on the provided context.

  API Documentation:
  {content}

techspecFileNamePrompt: |
  Generate a concise filename for the technical specification document without any spaces or special characters, 
  just the name with single world with the same name as the connector name in the techspec: {tech_spec}
  If unable to generate, return "tech_spec_{connector}"
  Only return the filename without any additional text or formatting.
  {isConnectorAvailable}
  Don't give generic names like payments and all, try to find the unique connector name from the techspec
  strictly follow the instructions.

techspecMockServerPrompt: |
  Create an express server which mocks all the api calls mentioned here. 
  If encryption is required use crypto or some popular libraries to handle it. 
  Print all endpoints created after server starts running.
  IMPORTANT: Make the server run on port 5000 (not 3000) to avoid conflicts. Use const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
  Format your response exactly like the JSON given below and don't respond with any subscript like "of course" or "here you go":
  \{
    "server_js": "// Your server.js code here - MUST use port 5000",
    "package_json": "// Your package.json content here", 
    "info": "// Simple Markdown text providing all generated curls with port 5000"
  \}
  {tech_spec}

searchQueryPrompt: |
  Generate a list of 2-5 specific research queries to gather detailed information about the API documentation for the connector with the following URLs: {urls}.
  The queries should focus on extracting comprehensive details about the API endpoints, authentication methods, request/response structures, error handling, and any other relevant technical specifications.
  Ensure that the queries are clear, concise, and targeted towards obtaining the necessary information to create a complete technical specification document.
  Return the queries in a numbered list format.
  but remember each query should be highly specific not more than 5 words
  also focus on postman or openapi documentation you can include that in the queries
  don't focus on limits or pricing related queries
  all you have to focus on is api documentation for integration 
  for this connectorName : {connector_name}
  strictly follow the instructions.
  Avoid using github, stackoverflow, quora or any forums as sources for these queries.
  Focus solely on official documentation, developer portals, and reputable API reference sites.
  make the sure the queries are specific to api documentation only containing the domain in the URL and docs or api.
  give in JSONArray of string format.

connectorNamePrompt: |
  Extract and return the connector name from the given query : {query}
  The connector name should be a single word without spaces or special characters.
  If unable to determine the connector name, return "".
  always try to return the connector name.
  if it is combined word return a string with spaces in lower letters.
  only return a string without any additional text or formatting. don't even add "" or ''.

urlsRelevancePrompt: |
  You are an expert in identifying relevant API documentation sources.
  The actual query used to search for the documentation is: "{query}"
  The connector name is: "{connector_name}"
  The following is a list of URLs that may contain API documentation for the connector.
  {urls}
  Now,
  Determine which URLs are most likely to contain relevant API documentation for the connector.
  Consider factors such as the presence of keywords like "docs", "api", "developer", or "reference" in the URL structure.
  Return a list of URLs that are most relevant for obtaining API documentation.
  **The output should be a JSON array of strings in the format** : [url1, url2, ...]
  If none of the URLs are relevant, return an empty list.
  strictly follow the instructions.
  basically ignore the unofficial pages or links to avoid forums or community pages.
  remember to avoid using github, stackoverflow, quora or any forums as sources for these urls.
  try to only focus on official documentation, developer portals, and reputable API reference sites.
  ignore all the links other than official links.
  remember official links are the one which contains the connector name in the domain.
  remove duplicate urls if any.
  You can also pass the postman or openapi links for the specific {connector_name} if available in the urls

searchResultExtractionFromHTML: |
  Extract search results from the following Markdown content. The search was performed for the query: "{query}"
  also consider the connector name: "{connector_name}" and focus on actual docs links in the results.
  don't include any results that are not relevant to API documentation.

  Please extract all search results and return them as a JSON array with the following structure:
  [
      {{
          "title": "Result title",
          "url": "Result URL",
          "snippet": "Result description/snippet"
      }}
  ]

  MarkDown Content:
  {html_content}
  try to find the links related to query
  if you unable to produce complete json return url and make title and snippet as empty string.
  ignore google links or any ads links in the results.

  Return only the JSON array, no additional text.

pageContentValidationPrompt: |
  You are an expert in analyzing API documentation. the following query was used to find the documentation: "{query}"
  Validation Criteria:
  - The page must contain comprehensive API documentation for the connector named "{connector_name}".
  - The documentation should include details such as endpoints, authentication methods, request/response structures,
  error handling, and any other relevant technical specifications.
  - The content should be structured in a way that facilitates understanding of the API.
  - Are there clear sections detailing API endpoints?
  - Is authentication information provided?
  - Are request and response formats described?
  - Is error handling covered?
  - Don't consider pages that are merely overviews, marketing materials, or unrelated content or just headings.
  - Is the content structured in a way that facilitates understanding of the API?
  Based on the above criteria, determine if the page is relevant for extracting API documentation.
  also if the page contains partial information you can still consider it as relevant.
  from the pages it has to give the further references links to get more information about the api documentation.
  Format your response as a JSON object with the following fields:
  - is_relevant (boolean): true if the page meets the criteria, false otherwise.
  - reason (string): A brief explanation of why the page is considered relevant or not.
  - further (array of strings): A list of URLs for further reference to obtain more information about the API documentation, if applicable.
  - don't return any urls which are not related to connector api documentation
  In pages, it may contain links in a way like /api/authoritations or /docs/api/reference etc. then you have to give like actual url by combining with the base url (domain url example: https://connector.com/ even the url is https://connector.com/docs/*). try to generate on the content and give the relevant links only in further field.
  for now give the is_relevant as true always.
  Only respond with {"is_relevant": true, "reason": "...", "further": [url1, url2]} based on whether the page meets the above criteria.
