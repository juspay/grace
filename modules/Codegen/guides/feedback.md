# 1. CRITICAL PATTERNS (MUST FOLLOW)

> **Purpose:** Non-negotiable UCS architectural requirements that MUST be followed in every connector implementation.

**Status:** Ready for population - Add critical patterns discovered during connector implementations

**Template Example:**

### FB-001: Use RouterDataV2, Never RouterData

**Metadata:**
```yaml
id: FB-001
category: UCS_PATTERN_VIOLATION
severity: CRITICAL
connector: general
flow: All
date_added: 2024-01-15
status: Active
frequency: 0
impact: High
tags: [ucs-architecture, router-data, breaking-change]
```

**Issue Description:**
UCS architecture requires `RouterDataV2` instead of legacy `RouterData`. Using the wrong type will cause compilation failures and architectural incompatibilities.

**Code Example - WRONG:**
```rust
use hyperswitch_domain_models::router_data::RouterData;

fn process_payment(
    data: &RouterData<Flow, Request, Response>
) -> Result<...> {
    // This will not compile in UCS
}
```

**Code Example - CORRECT:**
```rust
use domain_types::router_data_v2::RouterDataV2;

fn process_payment(
    data: &RouterDataV2<Flow, FlowData, Request, Response>
) -> Result<...> {
    // Correct UCS pattern
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- UCS uses enhanced type safety with separate flow data
- RouterDataV2 provides better separation of concerns
- Required for gRPC integration
- Ensures compatibility with UCS architecture

**How to Fix:**
1. Find all occurrences of `RouterData<`
2. Replace with `RouterDataV2<`
3. Add appropriate flow data type parameter
4. Update imports to `domain_types::router_data_v2::RouterDataV2`

**Auto-Fix Rule:**
```
IF file contains "RouterData<" AND NOT "RouterDataV2<"
THEN suggest: "Replace RouterData with RouterDataV2 and add flow data parameter"
```

**Related Patterns:**
- See: guides/patterns/README.md#ucs-architecture
- See: FB-002 (ConnectorIntegrationV2)

**Prevention:**
- Always use UCS templates as starting point
- Run quality checks after each flow implementation
- Reference existing UCS connectors for patterns
